This solution addresses the unreliability of `Linking.addEventListener` by incorporating a persistent background service to monitor deep links.  This service uses a different mechanism to listen for deep links even if the main application is in the background.

This solution requires configuring a background service, which is outside the scope of this simple example but it's a necessary step to ensure reliability.

```javascript
// Note: This solution requires additional setup for a persistent background service - this is a simplified illustration.
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import { registerForPushNotificationsAsync } from './pushNotifications'; // Requires implementing push notifications

// Background service to listen for deep links, separate implementation
// This would handle deep links even when the app is backgrounded and Linking.addEventListener fails.
registerForPushNotificationsAsync();

Linking.getInitialURL().then(url => {
  if (url) {
    console.log('Initial URL:', url);
    // Handle the initial URL
  }
});

Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
  console.log('URL received:', event.url);
  // Handle the URL here.  This will function better, but not completely reliably in the background.
});
```
