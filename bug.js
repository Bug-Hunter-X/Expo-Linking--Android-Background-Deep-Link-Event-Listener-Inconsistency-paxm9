This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links on Android.  If the app is launched from a deep link while it's already running in the background, the `Linking.addEventListener` might not fire, and the app won't correctly handle the link. This is different from when the app is completely closed; in that case, `Linking.addEventListener` works correctly. This inconsistent behavior between background and closed states is the uncommon error.  

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
  console.log('URL received:', event.url);
  // Handle the URL here
});

Linking.getInitialURL().then(url => {
  if (url) {
    console.log('Initial URL:', url);
    // Handle the initial URL
  }
});
```
